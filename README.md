# kalventure

Kalventure is a game which encourages exercise. Participants will play games to exercise and help KAL programmers defeat KAL.

This project was done as part of the LMU CMSI 401 class during the fall of 2014.  Check out the [Prezi for the final presentation](https://prezi.com/7wimqbfewkpz/kalventure/).
